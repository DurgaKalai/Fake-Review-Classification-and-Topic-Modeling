# Fake-Review-Classification-and-Topic-Modeling
# Objective 
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can classify reviews as either fake or real by leveraging a combination of traditional machine learning, deep learning models, and Transformer-based approaches. Additionally, the system will cluster similar reviews together to group related feedback, making it easier to analyze customer insights. Furthermore, it will identify underlying topics within the reviews, providing a deeper understanding of customer sentiments and issues, ultimately helping to uncover patterns and concerns expressed by users.
